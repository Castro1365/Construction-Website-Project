# Wireframes (Text Description)

Because this is a small project, wireframes are described in text form.

**Layout**

- Top: Full-width header with company name/logo and navigation bar.
- Middle: Hero section with short welcome text and "Request a Quote" button.

## 3. About Page (about.html)

- Section: "Who We Are" – paragraph about company.
- Section: "Our Values" – bullet list.

## 4. Contact Page (contact.html)

**Layout**

- Header + navigation.

These textual wireframes guide the design of the actual HTML pages in `/src`.
